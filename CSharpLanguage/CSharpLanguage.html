Records are distinct from classes in that record types use value-based equality. Two variables of a record type are equal if the record type definitions are identical, and if for every field, the values in both records are equal.</p>

                    <p>An interface is a contract: it specifies what members (methods and properties) a class implementing the interface must have. But interfaces will contain only the declaration of the members. It is only a contract, it has no implementations. Only very simple implementations by default for simple methods. A class can implement zero, one or multiple interfaces.</p>
                    <p>An interface can not specify the access level for methods or properties like protected or private, and they are public by default. An abstract class can limit the access level for methods and properties. The only exception is an abstract method that can not be private.</p>
                    <p>An interface can not have the declaration of constructors. If attempted, it treats them as different methods making the script implement both. An abstract class can have the declaration of constructors.</p>
                    <p>The interface can not have standard fields. They have to be properties with a get and set. The abstract class can have standard fields and properties.</p>
                    <p>When making changes to an interface, all inheriting scripts have to be changed to implement the changes or throw an error. When making changes to an abstract class, unless the added change was an abstract method, there is no need to change any other code since you can add the base implementation.</p>

                  <div class="accordion-body">
                    <p>Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming (OOP) that enables a class to derive properties and behavior from another class. The class that is being derived from is called the base class, and the class that is deriving from the base class is called the derived class. In C#, inheritance is implemented using the ":" symbol followed by the name of the base class.</p>
                    <p>To use inheritance effectively in C#, you should follow these best practices:
                      <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                        <li class="list-group-item">Use inheritance to model an "is-a" relationship: Inheritance should be used when the derived class "is a" type of the base class. For example, a Car "is a" Vehicle, so you can use inheritance to derive a Car class from a Vehicle class.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">Avoid deep inheritance hierarchies: Deep inheritance hierarchies can make your code difficult to understand and maintain. You should try to keep the inheritance hierarchy as shallow as possible, ideally with no more than three levels of inheritance.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">Favor composition over inheritance: In some cases, composition (using objects as member variables of a class) can be a better alternative to inheritance. This can help reduce the complexity of your code and make it easier to understand.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">You should consider using composition over inheritance in C# in the following situations:</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">
                          <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                            <li class="list-group-item">1. When you want to reuse behavior across multiple classes, but there is no "is-a" relationship: Inheritance is appropriate when you have a base class that defines behavior that is common to all derived classes. However, if you have behavior that is shared between classes that do not have an "is-a" relationship, composition may be a better choice. For example, if you have a ShoppingCart class and a Product class, you could use composition to give the ShoppingCart a list of Products, rather than creating a derived class for each type of shopping cart.</li>
                            <li class="list-group-item">2. When you want to change behavior at runtime: With inheritance, the behavior of a derived class is determined at compile-time. If you need to change behavior at runtime, composition may be a better choice. For example, you could use composition to give a class a strategy object that can be changed at runtime to alter its behavior.</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>

                    <p>Test case coverage can be determined by identifying the requirements or specifications of the system under test and then creating test cases that verify that each requirement or specification is fulfilled. This can be done through techniques such as boundary value analysis, equivalence partitioning, and decision table testing. Test coverage can also be measured using tools such as code coverage analysis, which examines which portions of the code have been executed during testing, or requirements traceability matrix, which tracks the relationship between requirements and test cases. The level of test case coverage required will depend on the specific project and its goals.</p>

                    <p>Functional testing is used to verify that the software meets the specified functional requirements and performs its intended functions correctly. This type of testing checks that the software behaves as expected in response to various inputs and under different conditions. Functional testing is typically performed using test cases that are based on the requirements or specifications of the software.</p>
                    <p>Non-functional testing, on the other hand, is used to verify that the software meets the non-functional requirements, such as performance, security, usability, and reliability. This type of testing checks the quality attributes of the software, which are not related to the functionality.

                    <p>Severity and priority are two different concepts in software testing:</p>
                    <p>Severity refers to the degree of impact a defect or issue has on the system, product, or application being tested. Severity is usually measured on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being the most severe and 5 being the least severe. A severe defect could cause system failure or data loss, while a less severe defect might just cause a cosmetic issue or inconvenience for the user.</p>
                    <p>Priority refers to the order in which defects or issues should be addressed based on their impact on the project and the stakeholders involved. Priority is usually measured on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being the highest priority and 5 being the lowest priority. A high priority defect might need to be fixed immediately to avoid a major impact on the project, while a low priority defect could be addressed later when resources and time permit.</p>
                    <p>In general, severity indicates the impact of a defect on the product, while priority indicates the importance of fixing the defect relative to other tasks and priorities in the project.</p>

                    <p>Ad-hoc testing is a type of software testing that is performed without any formal or pre-defined test cases or plans. It is an informal and unstructured approach where testers randomly test the software application based on their experience, intuition, and knowledge of the application. Ad-hoc testing is typically performed when there is limited time for testing or when a tester wants to explore and identify defects that might not be found through formal testing techniques.</p>

                    <p>Static testing and dynamic testing are two different approaches to software testing.</p>
                    <p>Static testing is a testing technique in which the software is examined without being executed. This type of testing involves reviewing code, documentation, and other artifacts to identify defects or issues before the software is actually run. Static testing can include techniques such as peer reviews, walkthroughs, and inspections.</p>
                    <p>Dynamic testing, on the other hand, involves the execution of the software in order to find defects or issues. This type of testing is performed by executing test cases or test scripts and observing the behavior of the software. Dynamic testing can include techniques such as functional testing, regression testing, and performance testing.</p>
                    <p>In summary, the main difference between static and dynamic testing is that static testing is performed without actually executing the software, while dynamic testing involves executing the software to observe its behavior.</p>

                    <p>Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development approach where test cases are created before the actual implementation code.

This process is repeated for every feature or requirement, with new test cases being added along the way to ensure that previously implemented functionality remains intact. The goal of TDD is to create high-quality, reliable code that is thoroughly tested and easily maintainable.</p>

                    <p>Behavior-driven development (BDD) is a software development methodology that focuses on defining the expected behavior of a system in natural language, which can be understood by both technical and non-technical stakeholders. BDD involves collaboration between developers, QA testers, and business stakeholders to create a shared understanding of the requirements and desired outcomes of a system. BDD typically involves the use of a domain-specific language (DSL) that allows stakeholders to describe the desired behavior of the system in a structured format. The DSL is then used to generate automated tests that verify the system's behavior. BDD is often used in Agile development methodologies and is intended to promote collaboration and a shared understanding of the system's behavior among all stakeholders.</p>

                    <p>Load testing involves testing a system under a specific load, usually the expected or maximum user load, to determine its behavior, performance, and responsiveness. It measures the system's ability to handle the expected load and ensures that it is functioning as expected without crashing or slowing down.</p>
                    <p>Stress testing, on the other hand, is a technique used to test a system's ability to handle extreme workloads, beyond its design limits, and determine its breaking point. Stress testing is performed to identify the system's failure points and measure how it behaves under extreme conditions.</p>
